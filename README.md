Scripts to test the hardware of your computer

Michael McMahon

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THESE SCRIPTS INTENTIONALLY PLACE STRAIN ON YOUR SYSTEM.  IF YOU CANNOT ACCEPT HARDWARE FAILURE, DO NOT USE THESE SCRIPTS.

These scripts are not meant to be run from your operating system.  Boot up a live GNU/Linux distribution first and then run the script.

Download links for compatible live GNU/Linux Distributions:

 -<a href="https://grml.org/download/">GRML</a>
 
 -<a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/">Ubuntu 14.04</a>
 
 -<a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/">Ubuntu 16.04</a>

If there is a problem with your hardware, hopefully this script will cause your computer to crash.  Finding the part of the script that crashes can help troubleshoot the problem area.

Bash scripts can do nearly anything to your system.  In general, always read over scripts before using them.  If you want to remove functionality or a test, remove a line or add a pound sign (#) at the beginning of unwanted lines.

Contributions:

-I have made scripts for some specific live operating systems.  Please contribute changes for more operating systems.

-I am looking for more tests.

-Eventually, I would like to build my own live GNU/Linux distro that runs this script automatically.
